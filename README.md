# ToKa Fitness 🏋️

**ToKa Fitness** is a fictional fitness tracking web application built as part of my preparation for my T Level Digital, OSP. The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world software solution for a client in the health and fitness industry.

## 👨‍💻 About the Client (Fictional)

**ToKa Fitness** is a made-up fitness club that wants to offer members an online portal where they can:
- Log their workouts and meals
- Track their health progress
- Access premium fitness content
- Manage their membership profile

This is a simulated client created for educational purposes and is not a real business.
